# Repository Audit

## Architecture Overview

The project provides a Python backend built with [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) and a minimal web UI. Source code resides under `backend/` with application logic in `app/` and a CLI in `chatagent/`. Data files are kept under `data/` and documentation under `docs/`.

## Dependencies

Dependencies are managed via `pyproject.toml` and target Python 3.10+. Key packages include FastAPI, Pydantic v2, SQLModel, httpx, websockets, and a Google Gemini stub. Some versions are pinned loosely and may require updates to stay current and secure.

## Test Coverage

A test suite exists under `backend/tests/` covering API validation, scheduling, and persistence. However, missing dependency installation prevents running the tests in this environment, so actual coverage remains unverified.

## CI/CD

No GitHub Actions workflows or other CI configuration are present. Continuous integration is currently absent and should be introduced to run tests and linters on each commit.

## Security

No secrets are committed; configuration uses environment variables such as `CHATAGENT_GOOGLE_API_KEY`. Dependency updates and vulnerability scanning are not yet automated.

## Developer Ergonomics

Linting and formatting tools (e.g., Ruff, Black) are not configured. A devcontainer or Docker setup is absent. Local setup requires manual virtual environment creation and editable install.

## Recommendations and Backlog

### Core
- Implement real LLM client integrations and ensure deterministic scheduling.
- Expand test suite to cover web UI and error paths.

### Infra
- Add GitHub Actions workflow for linting and tests.
- Introduce dependency update automation and security scanning.
- Provide Dockerfile or devcontainer for reproducible environments.

### Docs
- Expand developer onboarding guide.
- Document API endpoints and scenario format in detail.

> Note: GitHub Issues and a Project board were not created due to missing credentials. Each backlog item above should be tracked as an Issue and organized on a kanban board.
